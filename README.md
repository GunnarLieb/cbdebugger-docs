# Introduction

## Welcome To The ColdBox Debugger Module

The ColdBox Debugger module is a lightweight performance monitor and profiling tool for ColdBox applications. It can generate a nice debugging panel on every rendered page or a dedicated visualizer to make your ColdBox application development nicer, more funner and greater! Yes, funner is a word!
